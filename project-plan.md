# Math Monsters - Project Plan

## Overview
Math Monsters is an educational 3D game built with Three.js that combines Minecraft-style block-based world exploration with math problem-solving. Players navigate through a colorful environment, encounter monsters, and must solve grade-appropriate math problems to progress.

## Core Features

### 1. World Environment
- Block-based terrain using Three.js geometry
- Minecraft-inspired textures and materials
- Simple day/night cycle for visual interest
- Basic collision detection for player movement
- Colorful and engaging environment with different biomes (grassland, desert, snow)

### 2. Player System
- First-person camera controls
- Basic movement (walk, jump)
- Health system (8 lives)
- Grade selection at game start
- Simple inventory system for collected items

### 3. Monster System
- Different types of monsters based on grade level
- Monster spawning mechanics
- Monster AI (basic movement and player tracking)
- Monster health system
- Visual feedback when monsters are defeated

### 4. Math Problem System
- Grade-appropriate math problems (4 per monster)
- Multiple choice answers
- Immediate feedback on correct/incorrect answers
- Health penalty for incorrect answers
- Progress tracking for solved problems

### 5. UI/UX
- Health bar display
- Grade selection menu
- Problem display interface
- Score tracking
- Game over screen
- Victory screen
